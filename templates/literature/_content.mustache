			Literature on Phylogenetic Nomenclature<br>
			<small>Philip D. Cantino and Kevin de Queiroz</small>
		</h1>
		<p>
			The following is a list of publications dealing with phylogenetic nomenclature, which is intended to provide access to the literature on that subject.
			The list is divided into categories emphasizing particular aspects of phylogenetic nomenclature.
			Because these categories are not always mutually exclusive, some papers are listed under more than one category.
			The list is undoubtedly incomplete (particularly in the category &quot;Other Applications of Phylogenetic Nomenclature&quot;) but should provide a good starting point for anyone wishing to explore the subject.
		</p>
		<p>
			Because we had to draw the line somewhere, a number of related papers have been excluded.
			For example, we did not list all papers that used widely known names for crown clades (a convention commonly associated with phylogenetic nomenclature that is neither a necessary component of the approach nor supported by some of its advocates); instead, we only included those papers if they also used explicit phylogenetic definitions.
			In general, the list contains papers in which explicit phylogenetic definitions are either used or discussed.
		</p>
		<p>
			We intend to update the list as new information becomes available.
			If you notice omissions or feel that a paper has been assigned to the wrong category (or should be listed under additional categories), please contact Phil Cantino (<script type="text/javascript">befuddle_epadr('cantino','ohio.edu');</script>) or Kevin de Queiroz (<script type="text/javascript">befuddle_epadr('dequeirk','si.edu');</script>).
